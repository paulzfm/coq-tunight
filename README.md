# Code is Cheap, Show Me the Proof

This repository contains the source code of [this TUNIGHT talk](https://tuna.moe/event/2020/coq-proof/):

- `Logic.v` (Tutorial 1: Logic & Curry-Howard Correspondence)
- `FP.v` (Tutorial 2: Functional Programming & Functional Correctness)
- `ToyLang.v` (Tutorial 3: Formalizing Your Theory)

I used Coq 8.11.2. The above sources should be compiled by the latest Coq compiler.
